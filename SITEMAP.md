# UrbanAir Intel — Frontend Sitemap & Backend Contract

Maps every frontend route to the backend endpoints it consumes today and the
endpoints it will need as the backend matures. Use this as the checklist when
improving the backend: anything marked **NEEDED** is a UI surface already built
(or stubbed with a "Planned" note) waiting for data.

All routes live under `frontend/app/` (Next.js 14 App Router). Global shell:
`components/AppShell.tsx` — sidebar nav, mobile drawer, skip-to-content link,
API health indicator (polls `GET /health` every 30 s).

## Per-page contract

### `/` — Overview (`app/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /grid/readings?city_slug&parameter=pm25` — mean/peak PM2.5 computed client-side
- `GET /forecast/metrics?city_slug` — RMSE badge
- `GET /agents/recommendations?city_slug` — latest intervention card
- `GET /advisory?city_slug&lang` (via `AdvisoryCard`)

**Available, not yet consumed:**
- `GET /stats/summary?city_slug` — server-computed mean/max/category + 24h trend
  delta (client still averages the full readings payload; switch to this)

**NEEDED:**
- WebSocket or SSE push for live snapshot updates (currently load-time fetch only)

### `/map` — Live Map (`app/map/page.tsx`, `components/AqiMap.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /grid/cells?city_slug`
- `GET /grid/readings?city_slug&parameter`
- `GET /forecast/grid?city_slug&horizon_hours=72` — horizon scrubber (Live/+1h…+72h)
- `GET /agents/recommendations` — anomaly marker + patrol route overlay

**Available, not yet consumed:**
- `GET /stations?city_slug` — CAAQMS station locations + freshness for markers

**NEEDED:**
- Vector/GeoJSON tiles or cell simplification for city counts >5k cells (payload size)
- Parameter switcher backend support beyond pm25 (pm10, no2 exist in ingestion —
  expose via `/grid/readings?parameter=`; UI toggle is trivial to add once verified)
- Ward boundary GeoJSON (`GET /wards?city_slug`) for ward-level choropleth mode

### `/forecast` — Forecast Explorer (`app/forecast/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /forecast/grid?horizon_hours=72` — per-horizon city mean/peak table
- `GET /forecast/metrics` — 24h-direct + 1h RMSE vs persistence

**Available, not yet consumed:**
- `GET /forecast/cell/{grid_id}?city_slug&horizon_hours&history_hours` — observed
  history + hourly forecast series for one cell (trend-chart payload)

**NEEDED:**
- Uncertainty quantification in forecast response (p10/p90 bands)
- Scenario endpoints (wind shift / rain washout what-ifs) — stretch

### `/attribution` — Source Attribution (`app/attribution/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /agents/recommendations` — reads `attribution` (category, confidence,
  rationale, evidence list, llm_used) from each run

**NEEDED:**
- `GET /attribution/wards?city_slug` — standing ward-level attribution heatmap
  (today attribution only exists inside anomaly-triggered agent runs)
- Emission-inventory comparison endpoint (judged criterion: accuracy vs
  ground-truth inventories)
- Construction permits / industrial registry ingestion + overlay data

### `/enforcement` — Enforcement Intelligence (`app/enforcement/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `POST /agents/run?city_slug&synthetic_grid_id` — drill trigger
- `GET /agents/recommendations` — run history (client keeps session-local list)
- `GET /grid/cells` — picks the central-Delhi cell for drills

**Available, not yet consumed:**
- `GET /agents/runs?city_slug&limit&offset` — persisted, paginated run history
  with dispatch state + `mean_signal_to_dispatch_minutes`
- `POST /agents/runs/{id}/status?status=dispatched|inspected|closed&assignee=` —
  enforced lifecycle transitions, each stamped; backs the
  signal-to-intervention-time metric the brief judges

**NEEDED:**
- Evidence-pack export (`GET /agents/runs/{id}/report.pdf`)

### `/advisory` — Citizen Advisory (`app/advisory/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /advisory?city_slug&lang` — all six languages live (`en|hi|kn|ta|bn|mr`),
  LLM-generated in-script with script-correct fallback templates

**NEEDED:**
- `GET /advisory/wards?city_slug` — per-ward advisories vs vulnerability layer
  (schools, hospitals, outdoor-worker zones)
- Push-channel endpoints (SMS/IVR/webpush subscriptions) — stretch

### `/cities` — Multi-City (`app/cities/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /grid/readings` for Delhi NCR; other four cities are static "onboarding
  planned" cards driven by `lib/aqi.ts` `CITIES[]`

**Available, not yet consumed:**
- `GET /cities` — registered cities with live/onboarding state, headline stats,
  and model availability (replaces the hardcoded `CITIES` array)

**NEEDED:**
- Onboard a second city (grid definition + ingestion + training) — every backend
  table is already keyed by `city_slug`, so this is config + compute, not schema
- Cross-city comparison endpoint (trend, intervention effectiveness, NCAP compliance)

### `/data` — Data & Pipeline (`app/data/page.tsx`)
**Uses today:**
- `GET /health`, `GET /grid/cells` (cell count), `GET /grid/readings` (snapshot time)
- Source table is static copy describing the five ingestion feeds

**Available, not yet consumed:**
- `GET /ingestion/summary?city_slug` — consolidated per-source health: last run
  (status, records, error), table row counts, and data freshness

**NEEDED:**
- Auth-gated manual re-ingestion buttons in the UI once that exists

## Theme — UX4G (India's government design system)

The app uses **UX4G** (NeGD/MeitY, ux4g.gov.in) via the official
`ux4g-web-components` npm package, imported in `app/layout.tsx`. Light
professional theme: UX4G indigo primary (`gov-*` in `tailwind.config.ts`,
from `--ux4g-color-primary-*` tokens), saffron secondary (`saffron-*`),
neutral grays, Noto Sans. Buttons use `.ux4g-btn` classes; the chart palette
(`#4a2bc2`/`#c47d00`) is UX4G primary/secondary, CVD-validated on white.
A Government-of-India identity strip (marked "prototype") tops every page.
UX4G components in use: `.ux4g-card` (all cards), `.ux4g-btn` primary/outline/danger
(all buttons and toggle groups), `.ux4g-alert` info/warning (PlannedNote,
ApiOfflineBanner), `.ux4g-table` (forecast + data tables), `.ux4g-breadcrumb`
(PageHeader on non-root pages), `.ux4g-progress-bar` (attribution confidence).
When adding UI, use `gov-*`/`saffron-*`/`neutral-*` — no `slate`/`sky` classes.

## Accessibility & UX conventions (keep when extending)

- Skip-to-content link; `<nav aria-label>`, `aria-current="page"` on active route
- All interactive elements keyboard-reachable with `focus-visible` rings
- Toggle groups use `role="radiogroup"`/`radio` + `aria-checked`
- Map cell selection echoed to an `aria-live="polite"` region (map itself is not
  screen-reader friendly — the tables on /forecast are the accessible equivalent)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables animations; color is never the only signal
  (bands always carry text labels)
- Advisory text carries `lang=` attribute for correct screen-reader pronunciation

## Adding a page checklist

1. Create `frontend/app/<route>/page.tsx` (client component, fetch via `lib/api.ts`)
2. Add the route to `NAV` in `components/AppShell.tsx`
3. Use `PageHeader` + `Card`/`StatCard` from `components/ui.tsx`
4. Mark not-yet-backed features with `PlannedNote` and record the missing
   endpoint in this file
